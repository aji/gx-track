gx-track, an SDL/OpenGL program for tracking Sega Genesis tunes

This code has no real license at the moment, so please contact me if
you want to do distribute it in any form.

PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT THIS, PLEASE.

The sound emulation in gx-track is copied straight out of GENS. I'm
leaving it out of the repo for now because it's GPLv2 licensed and
I don't know all the details of how that works. If you want to try
building gx-track, you will have to copy ym2612.c and ym2612.h from gens
and placing them in the gens-sound directory. Eventually you will have
to copy psg.h and psg.c too. There may also have been some changes to
the source itself as well (I think just encoding changes, line ending
changes, and maybe an #include here or there). I don't really know for
sure. At this time, nobody should be trying to build gx-track anyway,
though, so I am not concerned.

Until this repo has a proper README, this is just a place for me to keep
all my hard work.

The controls at current are as follows:

    F1             play pattern from beginning
    F2             play pattern from cursor
    F3             single step playback at cursor
    F4             stop playback and all sounds (panic key)
    Space          toggle edit
    Shift+Up/Down  change instrument
    Ctrl+Up/Down   change octave
    Ctrl+1,2,...   select octave directly
    Arrow keys     move cursor
    Tab            move to next channel
    Shift+Tab      move to previous channel
    Page Up        move cursor up to 16 rows up
    Page Down      move cursor up to 16 rows down
    DEL/Backspace  in edit mode, delete a note
    1              in edit mode, add note off

In edit mode, the keys may be used as a keyboard, as with most
trackers. The exact layout, if using QWERTY on a MacBook Pro looks
something like this, if the current octave were 0:

    |             |             |
    |             |2 3   5 6 7  |9 0   =
    |             q w e r t y u i o p [ ]
    |             |             |
    |s d   g h j  |l ;          |
    z x c v b n m , . /         |
    |             |             |
    C0            C1            C2

It's about as wide of a spread as is possible on a typical keyboard,
which is essential for artist comfort. Special functions will be modal
or accessed with modifier and function keys to avoid collisions with
note entry.
